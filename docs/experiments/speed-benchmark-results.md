# Route Speed Benchmark Results

This document captures a route-level speed comparison between the sync and async
matcher APIs on the real `products/products_mcc` processed-data section.

The benchmark includes:
- `zero-shot`
- `head-only`
- `full`

It reports separate timings for matcher construction, fit/training, cold query,
steady-state matching, and end-to-end wall time.

## Command

```bash
uv run python scripts/benchmark_async.py \
  --section products/products_mcc \
  --model default \
  --modes zero-shot head-only full \
  --max-entities 50 \
  --max-queries 25 \
  --multiplier 20 \
  --concurrency 8 \
  --output artifacts/benchmarks/speed-routes-products-mcc.json
```

## Key Findings

- `zero-shot` remains in a completely different speed tier from trained modes:
  `sync.match.bulk` reached `49,670.59 qps` and `async.match_batch_async`
  reached `34,530.44 qps`.
- `head-only` and `full` have very similar steady-state inference throughput on
  this workload, both landing around `90-104 qps`.
- The real difference between trained modes here is setup cost:
  `head-only` fit ranged from `87.73s` to `184.05s`, while `full` fit ranged
  from `127.91s` to `132.38s`.
- For async integration, `match_batch_async()` remains the best async route, but
  the trained-mode end-to-end cost is dominated by training rather than by route
  selection.

## Interpretation

- If you care about pure retrieval speed, `zero-shot` is still the practical
  default by a very wide margin.
- If you need supervised behavior, choose between `head-only` and `full`
  primarily on quality and training-budget grounds, not inference speed, because
  their steady-state route throughput is now very similar in this benchmark.
- `sync.match.bulk` and `async.match_batch_async` remain the right throughput
  routes for batched workloads across all modes.
- End-to-end cost changes the story substantially: trained modes can spend two
  to three orders of magnitude more time in setup/training than in the actual
  match loop.
