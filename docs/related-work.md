## Algorithm Approaches in 2026

### 1. NIL Prediction (Not-In-Lexicon)
Instead of forcing matches to closest entities, systems use:
- **Discrimination thresholds** - Dynamically calculated similarity cutoffs
- **NIL-classifiers** - Binary classification for match vs. no-match
- **Confidence scoring** - Probabilistic assessment of match quality

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
if max_similarity < threshold:
    return "NIL (New Entity Discovered)"
return best_match
```

### 2. Contrastive Projection Networks
- **Goal:** Align type-compatible entities while separating unrelated ones
- **Benefit:** Makes out-of-distribution entities easier to isolate
- **Technique:** Learned projection spaces with contrastive loss

### 3. Agentic Novelty Analysis
- **Approach:** Multi-phase LLM comparisons
- **Process:**
  1. Extract claims/features
  2. Compare against hierarchical taxonomy
  3. Identify truly novel contributions
  4. Generate evidence-based reports

### 4. Semantic Dissimilarity (ON Metric)
- **Formula:** Novelty = average distance to k-nearest neighbors in historical database
- **Use Case:** Quantifying how "different" an entity is from known examples

### 5. Semantic-Aware Blocking
- **Technique:** Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) on deep learning embeddings
- **Benefit:** Reduces search space without losing semantic nuances
- **Key:** Traditional blocking on embeddings, not raw text

# Known entities in Knowledge Base
kb_entities = ["Quantum Computing", "Deep Learning", "Genetic Engineering"]
kb_embeddings = model.encode(kb_entities)

def identify_entity(input_text, threshold=0.65):
    """
    Identify entity with NIL prediction for novelty detection.

    Args:
        input_text: Text to identify
        threshold: Similarity threshold below which entity is considered novel

    Returns:
        Tuple of (entity_name, confidence_score)
    """
    query_emb = model.encode([input_text])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_emb, kb_embeddings)[0]
    max_idx = np.argmax(similarities)
    max_score = similarities[max_idx]

    if max_score < threshold:
        return "NIL (New Entity Discovered)", max_score

    return kb_entities[max_idx], max_score

```python
class EnhancedNoveltyDetector:
    """Advanced NIL prediction with dynamic thresholds."""

    def __init__(self, base_threshold=0.65, adaptive=True):
        self.base_threshold = base_threshold
        self.adaptive = adaptive
        self.threshold_history = []

    def predict(self, query_embedding, kb_embeddings):
        """
        Predict entity with adaptive NIL classification.

        Returns:
            Tuple of (entity_id, confidence, is_novel)
        """
        similarities = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], kb_embeddings)[0]
        max_score = np.max(similarities)

        # Adaptive threshold based on historical performance
        threshold = self._calculate_adaptive_threshold() if self.adaptive else self.base_threshold

        is_novel = max_score < threshold
        entity_id = np.argmax(similarities) if not is_novel else None

        return entity_id, max_score, is_novel

    def _calculate_adaptive_threshold(self):
        """Calculate threshold based on precision/recall trade-offs."""
        # Implement adaptive threshold logic
        pass
```

**Benefits:**

    """Locality Sensitive Hashing on embeddings."""

    def __init__(self, n_neighbors=10, radius=0.5):
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
        self.radius = radius
        self.ann_index = None

    def build_index(self, embeddings):
        """Build ANN index for fast similarity search."""

        self.uncertainty_threshold = uncertainty_threshold
        self.labeled_pairs = []

    def get_uncertain_pairs(self, pairs, scores):
        """Return pairs with scores near threshold for human labeling."""
        uncertain = []
        for pair, score in zip(pairs, scores):
            if abs(score - 0.5) < self.uncertainty_threshold:
                uncertain.append((pair, score))
        return uncertain

    def incorporate_feedback(self, labeled_pairs):
        """Update model based on human feedback."""

        # Retrain or adjust thresholds based on feedback
```

**Benefits:**

        super().__init__()
        self.projection = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, projection_dim)
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.projection(x)

    def contrastive_loss(self, anchor, positive, negative, margin=1.0):
