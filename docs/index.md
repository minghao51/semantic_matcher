## Archive

### I want to use the library

1. Read [`quickstart.md`](./quickstart.md).
2. If processing large batches (1K+ queries), read [`async-guide.md`](./async-guide.md).
3. Run one of the maintained examples from `examples/`.
4. Use [`models.md`](./models.md) and [`matcher-modes.md`](./matcher-modes.md) to refine behavior.
5. Use [`troubleshooting.md`](./troubleshooting.md) if setup/runtime issues appear.

### I want to reproduce experiments

1. Read [`experiments/index.md`](./experiments/index.md).
2. Use the runnable scripts in `experiments/`.
3. Review [`experiments/benchmarking.md`](./experiments/benchmarking.md) or [`experiments/country-classifier-scripts.md`](./experiments/country-classifier-scripts.md) as needed.

### I want lower-level control

1. Read [`examples.md`](./examples.md).
2. Start from `examples/raw/`.
3. Refer to [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) for project internals.

### I want to contribute or plan features

1. Read [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for planned milestones
2. Review [`related-work.md`](./related-work.md) for context on similar systems
3. Review [`novelty-methods-research.md`](./novelty-methods-research.md) for proposed novelty-detection extensions
4. Check [`architecture.md`](./architecture.md) for implementation details
5. See GitHub issues for specific tasks and discussions

## Notes

- The package code lives in `src/novelentitymatcher/` (src-layout).
- Script experiments live in `experiments/`.
- Local generated outputs should go under `artifacts/`, not the repository root.
