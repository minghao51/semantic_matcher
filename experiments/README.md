# Experiments

This folder contains exploratory Python scripts and benchmark-style workflows that are not part of the stable public package API.

- Use `examples/` for user-facing usage demos.
- Use `src/semanticmatcher/` for package/library code.
- Use `notebooks/` for Jupyter `.ipynb` files only.
